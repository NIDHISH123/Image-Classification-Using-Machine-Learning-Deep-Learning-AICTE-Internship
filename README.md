###Image Classification Using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This repository contains a project that demonstrates image classification using machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques. It includes two models: MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet) and a custom CIFAR-10 model trained for classifying images into 10 categories. The project is designed for educational purposes and serves as an excellent example for beginners and enthusiasts exploring ML and DL concepts.

##Features
#MobileNetV2 (Pre-trained on ImageNet):

Classifies general images into one of 1,000 categories using the MobileNetV2 architecture.
Utilizes a pre-trained model to demonstrate the power of transfer learning.
Requires minimal computational resources while delivering robust performance.

#CIFAR-10 Custom Model:

Classifies images into one of 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
Includes a lightweight CNN model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset for educational purposes.
Demonstrates preprocessing, training, and prediction on a popular dataset.

###Key Highlights

##Streamlit Web Application:

User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.
Interactive navigation between the MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 models.

##Real-time Predictions:
